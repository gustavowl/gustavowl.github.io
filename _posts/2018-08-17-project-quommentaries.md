The purpose of this Project is to gather all personal study notes regarding Quantum Computing.
Notes regarding Quantum Information and Quantum Logic are very likely to be added in the future.
However, the initial focus is on **Quantum Computing**.
The study shall cover the following books,
* **Quantum Computation and Quantum Information - by Nielsen & Chuang**;
* An Introduction to Quantum Computing - by Kaye, Laflamme, and Mosca;
* Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists - by Noson & Mirco;
* Principles of Quantum Mechanics - by Shankar.

The topics of the first book are discussed with more emphasis and priority.
In the future, some papers may be explained as well.

This project's motivation is to provide for the community 
a set of formalised solutions to exercises,
alongside with a step by step explanation of some equations;
since the Quantum Computing learning curve is very steep in the beginning.
Thus, facilitating the understanding of students that may lack some of the required knowledge,
and hopefully encouraging incomers to persist studying.

The project is hosted in
<a href="https://github.com/gustavowl/quommentaries" target="_blank">

Additionally, any updates regarding this project or any Quantum Computing related topics are
very likely to be posted in
<a href="https://psiencephiction.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">
\|ψ⟩ence \|φ⟩ction Blog</a>.

The author benefits from this project by forcing himself to
study, understand, and explain some non-obvious topics.
The readers benefit from the constant references to equations or subsections
needed to properly understand an equation or exercise.

Complementary to this project, 
<a href="https://workedproblems.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Worked Problem’s website.</a>
contains some exercise solutions.
However, the number of posts is limited,
and some lack formalism or a detailed explanation.
Similar pages exist on the Web.
