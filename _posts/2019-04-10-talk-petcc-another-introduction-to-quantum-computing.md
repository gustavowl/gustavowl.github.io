One year after
<a href="{% post_url 2018-04-06-talk-petcc-introducao-a-computacao-quantica %}" target="_blank">
the previous PET-CC talk about Quantum Computing</a>,
I decided to give another introductory talk regarding the area.
This talk will be a more detailed version of
<a href="{% post_url 2019-03-16-talk-natal-tech-conference %}" target="_blank">
Natal Tech Conference's Talk</a>.

<a href="http://petcc.dimap.ufrn.br" target="_blank">UFRN's PET-CC</a> encourages its members to
give a lecture per semester on a topic of interest.
Not uncommonly, the talks cover researches in which the students participate.
The talks are usually announced on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/petccufrn/" target="_blank">
PETCC's Faceook Page</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/petccufrn/" target="_blank">
PETCC's Instagram</a>.

The talk

is being
advertised with the following summary (translated from Portuguese).

*This Thursday (April the 11th) in CIVT's Room B321 at 13:30, the petian Gustavo (a.k.a Koruja) will talk about Quantum Computing.
The topic is being constantly commented in both academic and business worlds
(companies such as IBM, Google and D-Wave).
The objective is to give a brief introduction, and
to deconstruct the idea of Quantum Computers as miraculous machines.*
