I was invited to give a presentation for the Quantum Computing group at the University of Latvia.
This presentation is a regular part of the research group's activities and
involves reviewing papers submitted to <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>.
I reviewed papers from 16 September to 11 October 2024 and highlighted those that caught my attention the most.
The presentation slides are available at
