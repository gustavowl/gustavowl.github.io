We generalised a technique for finding the hitting time of a quantum walk search
from one to multiple marked elements.
The technique has a few requirements to work.

The abstract is as follows.
*"The quantum walk is a powerful tool to develop quantum algorithms, which usually are based on searching
for a vertex in a graph with multiple marked vertices, Ambainis’s quantum algorithm for solving the element
distinctness problem being the most shining example. In this work, we address the problem of calculating
analytical expressions of the time complexity of finding a marked vertex using quantum walk-based search
algorithms with multiple marked vertices on arbitrary graphs, extending previous analytical methods based on
Szegedy’s quantum walk, which can be applied only to bipartite graphs. Two examples based on the coined
quantum walk on two-dimensional lattices and hypercubes show the details of our method."*
