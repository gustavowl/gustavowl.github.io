In this paper,
we presented the new version of Hiperwalk --
a quantum walk simulator that uses high-performance computing.
<a href="https://hiperwalk.org/">Hiperwalk</a> 2.0b is easier to use and
<a href="https://hiperwalk.org/docs/stable/install/#basic-installation">install</a> than
its previous version,
as it is distributed as a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">Python library</a>
with optional support to <a href="https://github.com/hiperblas">Hiperblas</a>.
This work was presented during the
<a href="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2023/">IEEE Quantum Week 2023</a>
conference.

The abstract is as follows.
*"The Hiperwalk package is designed to facilitate the simulation of quantum walks
using heterogeneous high-performance computing,
taking advantage of the parallel processing power of diverse processors such as
CPUs, GPUs, and acceleration cards.
This package enables the simulation of both the
continuous-time and discrete-time quantum walk models,
effectively modeling the behavior of quantum systems on large graphs.
Hiperwalk features a user-friendly Python package frontend with comprehensive documentation,
as well as a high-performance C-based inner core that leverages parallel computing for
efficient linear algebra calculations.
This versatile tool empowers researchers to better understand quantum walk behavior,
optimize implementation, and explore a wide range of potential applications,
including spatial search algorithms."*
