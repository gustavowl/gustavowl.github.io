<!--excerpt-->

The talk was originally advertised with the following summary (translated from portuguese).
*This week (Friday the 6th), the petian Gustavo (a.k.a Koruja) will talk about Quantum Computing.
The topic is being constantly commented in both academic and business worlds
(companies such as Google and IBM).
The objective is to give a historical vision,
to explain a few basic concepts, and to talk about some predictions in the topic*.

Since no professor was capable of orientating me;
I decided to study on my own.
This was my first talk.
It briefly covers the first chapters of

Nielsen and Chuang's</a> and

Kaye, Laflamme and Mosca's</a> books.
Albeit introductory, a positive feedback was given.
